# FLIRE-Breast-MRI-Registration

Based on deformable algorithm that was adapted from a non-linear registration technique for brain by Holland and Dale [Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Nonlinear registration of longitudinal images and measurement of change in regions of interest. 
Med Imag Anal 2011;15(4):489-97.doi: 10.1016/j.media.2011.02.005], FLIRE calculates three displacement fields corresponding 
to movement in each dimension for each voxel using signal intensity and Gaussian smoothing. Gaussian smoothing heavily blurs both 
the moving and target images by convolution with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of standard deviation, and smoothing is reduced in 
each successive iteration so that smaller differences in signal intensity become distinguishable. This technique aligns the most 
prominent signal intensity features before tuning finer details, which reduces the likelihood of converging to a suboptimal solution.

Other than the scripts included in this repository, the user would need to download 3 additional Matlab scripts from Mathworks File 
Exchange website below: "movepixels.m", "movepixels_2d_double.m", and "movepixels_2d_single.m".
